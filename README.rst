mini-tools
==========

Small tools for specific things I needed

Targeter
--------

Small app to make live raffles, taking a picture of the group of people and pointing to a random location on the picture. 

The common targeter (targeter.py) uses the camera and needs opencv, wx and PIL. There is also a targeter_static.py which takes a file (picture.jpg) instead of using the camera (and so it doesn't needs opencv). Yeah, I know, I will make a single app with settings to work on different modes.

Fisa_bot
--------

I developed this app to win a web trivia contest at PyCon Argentina 2012, organized by the Onapsys company. I won an Arduino, weee :D

It needs the requests and pyquery libs.
