mini-tools
==========

Small tools for specific things I needed

Targeter
--------

Small app to make live raffles, taking a picture of the group of people and pointing to a random location on the picture. 

The common targeter (targeter.py) uses the camera. There is also a targeter_static.py which takes a file (picture.jpg) instead of using the camera. Yeah, I know, I will make a single app with settings to work on different modes.

Requires: PIL, wx-python, opencv (not for the static version)

Fisa_bot
--------

I developed this app to win a web trivia contest at PyCon Argentina 2012, organized by the Onapsys company. I won an Arduino, weee :D

Requires: requests, pyquery.
