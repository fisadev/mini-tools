App to make live raffles, taking a picture of the group of people and pointing to a random location on the picture. 

The common targeter (targeter.py) needs opencv and PIL. There is also a targeter_static.py which takes a file (picture.jpg) instead of using the camera (and so it doesn't needs opencv). Yeah, I know, I will make a single app with settings to work on different modes.
